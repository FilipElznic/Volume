# 📢 Slingshot Volume: The "Revolutionary" Audio Interface

**Tired of boring, precise, and easy-to-use volume sliders?**
**Do you yearn for the days when changing a setting required skill, luck, and a basic understanding of projectile motion?**

Welcome to **Slingshot Volume**. The only volume controller that makes you work for your silence.

## 🌟 Features

- **Angry Birds-Style UX**: Why simply _slide_ a handle when you can violently **launch** a projectile at your desired decibel level?
- **Artisanal Trigonometry**: No heavy physics engines here. Just pure, hand-crafted `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` like our ancestors used to make.
- **High-Stakes Muting**: Miss the target? Too bad. The music stays loud. Get good.
- **The "Productivity" Background**: Successfully start the music to reveal a highly motivating background video. We promise it's not a 1987 hit single by Rick Astley. (It is).
- **Dual-Target System**:
  - 🎯 **The Bar**: Sets the volume.
  - 🔴 **The Button**: Toggles the music (and the meme).

## 🎮 How to Play (Use)

1.  **Grab** the speaker icon.
2.  **Pull Back** like you're about to take down a green pig.
3.  **Aim** with your heart, not your eyes.
4.  **Release** and pray it lands on a comfortable volume.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Clone this masterpiece.
2.  Install the dependencies (because even chaos needs structure):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The developer is not responsible for:

- Sudden bursts of 100% volume.
- The song "Never Gonna Give You Up" getting stuck in your head for 3-5 business days.
- Broken mice/trackpads from aggressive slinging.
